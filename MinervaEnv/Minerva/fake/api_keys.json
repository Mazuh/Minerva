This is just a model for the real json stored at '../env' directory.

- Do not write any comments (like this one) in '../env/api_keys.json', so
keep only the neat json.
- Caution: do not include the real directory in version control,
so keep 'env' gitignored.
- Despite this silly security measure, the real keys should only work 
work for certain IP conditions.
- This is temporary.
